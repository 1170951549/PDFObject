Project Update: April 2016
I'm pleased to announce PDFObject 2.0 has arrived! 

Completely rewritten for the HTML5 era, PDFObject 2.0 has BREAKING CHANGES and is not backwards-compatible.

For examples, instructions, and a general good time, check out the recently updated http://pdfobject.com

I have completed initial testing in IE9-11, MS Edge, Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and iOS Safari. PDF embedding is not supported by Safari in iOS -- it is not a PDFObject shortcoming!

If you find any issues, please report them here.



Project update: March 2016
Hello. I've finally written a 2.0 update, which I hope to release by the end of the month. (I do this in my spare time, which is in short supply these days.)

The new 2.0 version supports IE, supports PDF.js in Firefox, and (IMHO) includes some much-needed modernization. The changes are _breaking_ changes -- new, cleaner syntax -- but are worth it. I hope you agree.

I need to do more testing and write some documentation before I post it. Stay tuned. Thanks for following this project.


Project note: Oct 2014
Hi there. Sorry, I know this project has been stagnating for a while. Between my kids and day job, I have simply not had enough spare time to devote to this project, esp. keeping up with all of the browser testing -- the original PDFObject was released in 2008 when WinXP was still dominant, Google Chrome was a precocious upstart, MySpace was relevant, and HTML5 was still duking it out with XHTML 2.0.

Browser technology has matured incredibly in the last 6 years, and native PDF support (no plugin required) has grown quite a bit as well. I have not completely given up on PDFObject, but I think it needs a considerable update for the HTML5 world. I have already started working on an update, but can't guarantee when it will be ready, since this is all done in my spare time. Thanks for hanging in there, and thanks to the folks who have posted suggestions and merge requests.
